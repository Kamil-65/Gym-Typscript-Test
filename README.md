# Gym-Typscript-Test
Complete Typescript React Fitness Responsive Application web page.
created thanks to the ed-roh video lesson for practice purposes only.

using Node.js, Typscript, Vite, and Tailwind as CSS Framework. 

The web page is not perfect, I used this site to learn the languages used and understand the meaning of each step, between containers, functions, and React properties
