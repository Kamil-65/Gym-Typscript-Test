# Gym-Typscript-Practice
Complete Typescript React Fitness Responsive Application web page.
created thanks to the ed-roh video lesson for practice purposes only.

using React.js, Node.js, Typscript, Vite, and Tailwind as CSS Framework. 

The web page is not perfect, I used this site to learn the languages used and understand the meaning of each step, between containers, functions, and React properties

My study method was:
- Watch the entire video lesson to understand what I'm looking at, and also try to understand some steps.
- Watch the video lesson again from the beginning, taking notes of each step and giving a comment on each step to have a clearer mind of what I wrote.
- In the end, writing the code looking only at the notes taken, if I didn't understand something I went back to the video at that precise point.
